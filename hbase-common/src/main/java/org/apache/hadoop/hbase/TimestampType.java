/**
 * {@link TimestampType} is an enum to represent different ways of encoding time in HBase using
 * 64 bits. Time is usually encoded as a 64-bit long in {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.Cell}
 * timestamps and is used for sorting {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.Cell}s, ordering writes etc.
 * It has methods which help in constructing or interpreting the 64 bit timestamp and getter
 * methods to read the hard coded constants of the particular {@link TimestampType}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Enum {@link TimestampType} is dumb in a way. It doesn't have any logic other than interpreting
 * the 64 bits. Any monotonically increasing or monotonically non-decreasing semantics of the
 * timestamps are the responsibility of the clock implementation generating the particular
 * timestamps. There can be several clock implementations, and each such implementation can map
 * its representation of the timestamp to one of the available Timestamp types i.e.
 * {@link #HYBRID} or {@link #PHYSICAL}. In essence, the {@link TimestampType} is only used
 * internally by the Clock implementations and thus never exposed to the user. The user has to
 * know only the different available clock types. So, for the user timestamp types do not exist.
